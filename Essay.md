# In Defense of Spending Bitcoin

## Why use bitcoin?

To hodl or not to hodl – it’s a complex question.

Keeping bitcoin long-term as a store of value is a prudent use case for the technology. But in selective circumstances, I like spending bitcoin on goods and services. I’m especially keen on the idea if that means paying a woman outside of the crypto industry.

Don’t get me wrong: I’m against all varieties of shilling, but growing and strengthening the Bitcoin network inherently means diversifying participation. As Saifedean Ammous argued in The Bitcoin Standard: “The larger the size of the economy, the larger the opportunity for gains from exchange and specialization, and perhaps more significantly, the longer and more sophisticated the structure of production can become.”

## When is it worthwhile to transact with valuable assets such as bitcoin?

The answer for me is: “when you must.” Avoid it unless you can afford to either invest in or contribute to economic flows that counteract systemic inequality (meaning institutional or constructed lack of freedom, not inherent difference or capability).

Everything has an opportunity cost—and it better be a damn good opportunity.

On the other hand, the Austrian economic perspective of bitcoin’s value includes the idea that money aspires to be the most marketable commodity, plus the most salable asset. For bitcoin to become an asset whose holders can sell with ease, in favorable conditions, we’re going to need a lot more people using it.

Money is an evangelical phenomenon and one of the best ways to evangelize is to spend. Bitcoin’s economic heritage is too vast a topic to address all aspects in a single essay. But Ammous, in his pivotal book about bitcoin and economic history, calls Greece “the birthplace of modern civilization,” as King Croesus was the first to mint gold coins for trade. So we’ll start there.

In short, history shows we’ve never actually seen a free market with consensual participation among people of all genders. Today, bitcoin’s technical properties give it many advantages for rectifying that injustice through peer-to-peer transactions. Transacting with bitcoin can be a way to help enact social change precisely because Bitcoin permits cheap and secure self-custody.

To illustrate the degree to which gender impacts economic access, we’ll explore how a single silk garment, hand-crafted by an expert woman entrepreneur and paid for in bitcoin, could play into the broader legacy of money.

## Ancient Greece

The economic systems prevalent in ancient Greece, including King Croesus’s gold coins, didn’t develop in isolation. Nor did any single form of value mutually exclude other forms of money.

By the third millennium BCE, silver was already playing a privileged role as both a medium of exchange and a store of value in Egypt and Mesopotamia. Archaeological evidence suggests Levant states were using silver money as early as the first millennium BCE. Greek city-states established a system of money-printing circa 650 BCE.

The far-reaching Persian Empire linked coinage and economic ledgers to the government itself in the fifth century BCE with the Persepolis Treasury Archive, an accounting system for silver.

In ancient Greece in particular, textile manufacturing was one of the most robust commodities markets, where historian Alain Bresson chronicled “most of the production operations were performed by women.”

In his book, The Making of the Ancient Greek Economy: Institutions, Markets, and Growth in the City-States, Bresson continued: “Every young girl or adult woman, of whatever status, was typically supposed to be trained in this [weaving] activity.”

Women’s labor was intrinsically tied to her legal personhood. These ancient ideas still live on in our modern economy. After all, the “father of capitalism” Adam Smith was also a fierce advocate for gendered division of labor. (We’ll get to him later. Back to Greece.)

In the infamous scene from Xenophon’s Memorabilia, Socrates advises someone to “put the women of his household to work so they can provide revenue.” Archeological records show a series of trials between 330-322 BCE concerning women “wool-spinners” and slaves, which were found “guilty” of working for another man. Note that, in the trial, the woman’s labor belongs to her male guardian.

Yet women have been able to invest through fashion industry ventures since long before the emergence of Greek city-states. Women could own fine silks, even if they couldn’t own other forms of property. Beauty is itself a currency. Luxury textiles aided the tangible manifestation of beauty, which often played into marriage transactions.

A woman could collaborate with others in embroidery and weaving businesses without threatening the social order that economized her labor, as long as silver and gold profits went to the men.

Women’s economic history is defined by innovative usage of capital in forms not strictly controlled or defined by government bodies, the way coinage is often controlled.

By the Classical period (fifth and fourth centuries BCE), the Greek textile industry included more laborers than any other sector in the region, with innovative silk production processes diversifying luxury markets. There are a variety of ways the ancient textiles industry bore no resemblance to a “free” market.

In Politics, Aristotle argues “there must be a magistracy entrusted with supervising commercial contracts” in the agora (i.e. public marketplace).

Athenian trade regulations were no joke! Athenians were forbidden, on penalty of death, to loan money for the shipment of staple goods. Such regulations still frame most market activities today, even online purchases.

## Market myths

The fact is, there’s never been a widespread “free market.” Even the ancient Greek economy was strictly regulated.

In Laws, Plato argues authorities should ban imported purple dyes as a forbidden luxury, theoretically because local textile workers “should” be producing alternatives themselves. Note how women, as dominant producers and consumers of such goods, were subject to moral codes that defined acceptable economic participation.

“The predominance of women can be explained only by the presence of a well-developed textile industry,” Bresson wrote of the Classical period in Corinth. “Embroidery could be done by the cities’ expert women workers.”

These textile market norms stretched from the Mediterranean to China, across the Silk Road economy.

## Global silk exchange

Pearl-clutching bitcoin skeptics who argue decentralized currency can’t exist within functioning governments haven’t read much history.

Many civilizations have multiple currencies and forms of money at the same time. According to The Silk Road by Peter Frankopan, under the Han dynasty “silk was used alongside coins and grain to pay troops...silk became an international currency as well as a luxury product.”

In ancient China, the word bi, which meant “offerings” and later became “money,” could include pearls, jade, hemp, and silk cloth, just to name a few such valuables.

As historian Richard von Glahn wrote in Foundations of Fortune, in pre-modern China paper currency was not the ideal money for “wealthy individuals,” who instead preferred to “hold precious metals and commodities such as grain or silk.”

The importance of silk in cross-border trades, such as between Japanese and Chinese merchants, also included regions lacking government currencies. One of the oldest recorded fiat currencies is a paper currency issued by the Song dynasty in tenth-century China called jiaozi.

When governments around the world mismanage their economies, this often forces people to use commodities like textiles as currency.

Allahverdi Khan, the Persian governor of Fars during the Safavid dynasty (1501-1736), paid his troops with rolls of cloth during a coin shortage. Some estimates say that, by 1790, roughly 90 percent of the merchandise imported to Iran from India was purchased with other commodities.

We’ve seen assets that shift between being used as commodities, stores of value, and mediums of exchange before. However, throughout all this time, most forms of money were subject to asymmetrical access.

## Productivity

Bitcoin has not emerged as an economic force without inheriting some of the limited mindsets of its monetary heritage. Bias trickles down through academia, financial institutions, and tech industry norms. To counteract this, we must correct misconceived notions about market participants.

Around the time the Safavid dynasty ruled the Persian empire, over in Europe, the economist Adam Smith was pontificating about labor being restricted to “material production,” as if the women literally cooking his food and making his clothes, caring for his children, and cleaning up after him weren’t contributing to his access to free time and opportunities.

In particular, cooks, nannies, housekeepers, and other domestic workers were deemed by Smith to be “unproductive.” Women’s time is essentially imagined as an asset that can only be morally and logically used to benefit men’s “productivity.”

Even American forefather Alexander Hamilton put in his “Report on Manufactures” in 1791 that a husband’s source of profit can come from “the increased industry of his wife and daughters.” Enforcing this historic notion of men owning women’s time, sometimes their assets as well, relies on the fallacy that “free markets” are driven by emotion-less logic and “rational” self-interest.

It also promotes the veneration of technical contributions over soft skills. As London School of Economics professor Judy Wajcman wrote in TechnoFeminism:

"The association between technology, masculinity, and the very notion of what constitutes skilled work is still fundamental to the way in which the gender division of labour is being reproduced today... As the proportion of women engineers grows, for example, the strong relationship between the culture of engineering and hegemonic masculinity will eventually be dismantled."

Luckily, software and research contributions by women bitcoiners—which is easier to quantify—are also increasing over time. For example, Amiti Uttarwar and Neha Narula  both contributed to Bitcoin Core while Carla Kirk-Cohen, Valentine Wallace, and Lisa Neigut contributed to the Lightning Network scaling solution for bitcoin.

To be clear, every time a male bitcoiner’s female partner keeps their household running while he contributes to bitcoin projects, her labor is contributing to Bitcoin as well. Second-wave feminists have already raised this point. For example, Italian autonomist feminist Sylvia Federici fiercely debated the definitions of labor in her manifesto “Wages against Housework,” writing: “We want to call work what is work so that eventually we might rediscover what is love and create what will be our sexuality, which we have never known.”

Even today, women are still expected to perform emotional and domestic labor to facilitate a productive society, yet are rarely given tangible rewards for their valuable contributions.

## On mining

Gender dynamics have long been a part of almost every community’s economic value flows, in one way or another. So far, bitcoin is no exception.

Investing in bitcoin requires computer skills, free time, expendable capital, and financial literacy, all of which women historically have less of than their male counterparts.

This isn’t meant to shame men who benefit from bitcoin, but rather to highlight distribution discrepancies and create strong arguments for paying women in bitcoin, even if holding the asset is more personally advantageous to the payer in the short-term. Diversity makes the bitcoin ecosystem more robust.

Yet women’s self-interest, such as turning sexual capital into access to material wealth, is often painted as immoral behavior requiring social regulation. The term “gold digger” implies that a woman doesn’t have a right to access patriarchal wealth. Instead, she is herself a “trophy wife” to be possessed.

People laugh at women gaining social clout on Crypto Twitter through sexy selfies or bitcoin through sex work, as if this were not skillful alchemy for turning market demand for her body into long-term financial security. This is because women are not seen as the true owners of their bodies and time.

As such, several sex workers felt inspired to contribute pieces to this anthology to illustrate their perspectives on autonomy and monetary value. Like silk, time is also a currency. And money is power.

(This anthology explores the relationship between time and tangible value in Lisa Neigut’s contribution as well, an essay about the technical history of bitcoin.)

## Hypocritical self-interest

Taking a step back to the origins of our modern economy, the authorities who built it were mostly people who saw male self-interest as a virtue and female self-interest as a sin.

By 1859, according to American economist Nancy Folbre, women accounted for one-third of the industrial labor force in both France and England. Worker demographics in the New England region of the United States were similar at the time.

French economist and “free trade” shill Jean-Baptiste Say also argued in his Treatise of Political Economy that it was “unnatural” for women to “push ahead of men” in learning or earnings and the only occupations natural to women were dressmaking, beauticians, and cooking. His “virtues of competition” theory didn’t align with how he actually viewed people.

Thanks to the French Civil Code of 1804, a man could lawfully use violence to compel obedience from wives and children to control their earnings. He could also force a woman who conceived his child to marry him, and as such acquire her inheritance. And let’s not pretend—some people think women are property still today.

Markets have never been free because huge swaths of the population involved with production and economic systems, even by Smith’s hypocritical standards, lacked the freedom to choose their roles or currencies.

The England and Wales Census in 1871 tallied roughly a third of the workforce as “economically active” women in the “high-tech” garment manufacturing industry, according to economist Ha-Joon Chang. As such, legal and political autonomy became the focus of this early part of the self-sovereignty movement.

## Economic liberation

We have historical examples—from long before bitcoin—of economic tools that may be used in a variety of ways, regardless of formal hierarchical structures.

Since it is this feature—self-sovereign custody and transaction options—that makes bitcoin unique among global currencies in a digital world, any self-identified feminist may also be inherently bullish on bitcoin.

In the words of Judy Wajcman, feminist research focused on emerging technologies helps “deconstruct the designer/user divide” that hinders bitcoin adoption, as well as the imaginary barriers “between the production and consumption of artifacts.” This illuminates power dynamics on both sides of technological innovation, increasing utility by reducing illusions of consumers’ passiveness.

Such a shift won’t come quickly or organically. As long as women have attempted to reclaim their economic sovereignty, authorities have been sounding the alarm against them.

## Home of the free?

President Theodore Roosevelt was so afraid of women’s economic emancipation that he published a piece in the Ladies’ Home Journal in 1906, warning against “this new freedom.”

Previous generations of feminists brought us the notion of “working hours,” as opposed to free time, and human rights in the workplace, formalizing the acknowledgment that productivity requires social and physical health. The Uprising of the 20,000—a labor strike led by the International Ladies’ Garment Workers’ Union in 1909—was just one of many political movements by women workers to inspire labor laws that touch every sector across the economy.

Perhaps one of the lessons from the history of silk is that sometimes the world’s most powerful market forces are hidden in plain sight.

Acknowledging self-sovereignty across the spectrum of actors in a given market vastly improves productivity and ethical norms. Underappreciated labor skews the balance of supply and demand. As historian Kathi Weeks wrote, “freedom as the time and space for invention” decreases artificial market constraints. In short, everyone benefits from the ability to independently own one’s own assets and time.

In the case of many bitcoiners enamored with Austrian economics, some argue private enterprise is more virtuous and sensible than public, collective ventures. Luckily, this oversight isn’t inherent to all male economists.

“Woman's struggle to preserve her personality in marriage is part of that struggle for personal integrity which characterizes the rationalist society of the economic order based on private ownership of the means of production,” wrote Austrian economics icon Ludwig von Mises. “All mankind would suffer if woman should fail to develop her ego and be unable to unite with man as equal, freeborn companions and comrades.”

Even today, inheritance norms present a myriad of unfair and unnecessary hurdles to accessing wealth.

This anthology addresses that long-standing context through a work of creative prose, inspired by a true but anonymous bitcoiner’s story, told by entrepreneur Jenny Q. Ta. This tale shows how a mother denied access to the household’s assets could still use bitcoin as a tool for her children’s inheritance.

## Pirates

These are all reasons to be bullish! We might get a little closer to a proverbial “free market,” if we work at it.

Mutualism, as a complement to individualism, is actually one of the core principles of bitcoin. University of Virginia professor Lana Swartz described cryptocurrency development as “the ability to mutually build and support a collaborative platform upon which to transact, free from the prying eyes and interference of corporate intermediaries.”

Spending bitcoin can be one way to do this, by propagating a much freer (although not perfectly free) market. This lends bitcoin a social, and not strictly self-serving, economic function.

Looking back across history, there are already legacy models of collaborative governance where female peers managed self-sovereign assets, rebelled against the surrounding government apparatus, and still got to live happily ever after.

One such example is Ching Shih, a sex-worker-turned-pirate-queen who ruled the China Seas during the Jiaqing Emperor period of the Qing dynasty. Under her leadership, the pirate fleet grew to seventy thousand men. No other pirate has ever commanded so many ships. Plus, the fleet offered a case of effective yet collaborative governance.

She was also able to negotiate the largest pardon and peace treaty, directly with a government, of any pirate or rebel in history. Her crew retired in comfort. Thanks to independent wealth, plunder like precious metals and silks, Ching Shih was able to accrue economic power without first dismantling the entire socioeconomic system around her. This independent wealth, not controlled by the state, gave her leverage.

If we take bitcoin’s comparable property, self-sovereignty, and consider the barely century-old context where most (but not all) women have legal independence within the family, it’s clear to see bitcoin’s cypherpunk potential as well.

In many circumstances around the world today, whether a woman is saving bitcoin for a divorce lawyer or fundraising despite sexist venture capital norms, this self-sovereign asset gives her more leverage than other monetary tools.

Bitcoin isn’t a comprehensive solution for sexism. But, so far, it is a promising software tool for impacting social change.

## Cypherpunk feminism

Bitcoin might have been invented at a fortuitous time to improve economic systems, when the self-sovereignty movement has finally gained mass appeal.

Recall that “feminism” means viewing human beings as self-sovereign regardless of gender (which is the literal definition, no matter how much that word triggers the crypto Lam-bros).

According to Finn Brunton, author of Digital Cash, the person who invented the term “cypherpunk” was Jude “St. Jude” Milhon, cofounder of the Community Memory network and author of the short story “The Cypherpunk Movement.” She was one of the most prominent hackers to promote women in the burgeoning tech industry in the 1980s and 1990s.

I’d argue that we are still seeing waves of this same cypherpunk movement. Like feminism, the cypherpunk movement evolves with each generation. Unlike schools of economic thought, which provide static lenses through which to critique monetary systems, movements like feminism and cypherpunk can shift without splintering completely. They can even come to encompass conflicting perspectives.

A cypherpunk is a person interested in using privacy-enhancing technologies as a route to social and political change. We’re now equipped with software tools that allow the application of this ethos in a variety of contexts and activities. Bitcoin, in particular, is a tool that makes the cypherpunk ethos accessible to people with a wider range of skills, needs, and values.

Edith Clarke was the first woman to become an electrical engineer in the United States by graduating from the Massachusetts Institute of Technology (MIT) in 1919. Today, MIT helps train some of the most active bitcoiners in the world, from investors and bitcoin advocates such as Audrey Chaing (who helps focus on state-level policy developments through the Blockchain Working Group), Meltem Demirors (who contributed an essay about privacy tech to this anthology), and Neha Narula (director of MIT’s Digital Currency Initiative).

When one of the leading “fathers” of the internet, Vint Cerf, was asked if women played a leadership role in the internet’s early creation, he responded: “The first internet router was built by a woman, Virginia “Ginny” Strazisar, in 1975. There are women who have been part of this story for the past 40 years. And they deserve much more visibility than they have had so far.”

Technically and socially, we are now better equipped to build marketplaces defined by greater freedoms. Speaking of freedom, bitcoin is not compulsory. The underlying principle of a bitcoin transaction is consent and self-ownership.

In the same way that economist Ludwig von Mises argued sound money requires the absence of government control because too many succumb to the temptation to debase currency, so this same argument applies to patriarchal custody within the household.

## Pre-coiners


Today, there are millions of potential bitcoin users still underserved by traditional financial products and services.

Women are disproportionately represented among many such user groups, including undocumented domestic workers, victims of cyberstalking and financial abuse, sex workers, and underbanked entrepreneurs, just to name a few.

This anthology addresses the concept of abuse, in particular, through a short memoir piece by the self-professed compliance geek Amber Scott. In Scott’s case, it was parental abuse that taught her the value of censorship-resistant money.

For context, studies generally suggest the vast majority of domestic abuse survivors were also subject to financial abuse, where one person controls the other’s access to economic resources, including job opportunities and bank accounts. This forces the victim to depend on the perpetrator financially. The U.S. Department of Justice estimated in 2014 that one out of every four women will experience some type of gendered violence in her lifetime.

One such survivor of abuse from an intimate partner also contributed a poem to this anthology about how she used bitcoin to help herself and others afford to get away from their abusers. It might be tempting to think of these stories as isolated cases of extreme outliers. They are not. The National Organization for Women estimated in 2005 that three women are murdered by their intimate partners every day in the United States alone.

If you grew up whispering about these dangers in secret, as several contributors to this anthology did, it’s obvious the mainstream economic system was designed to reproduce women’s obedience to property-owning men. It was built for a world where self-sovereignty passed from father to son, often skipping over daughters entirely. Bitcoin doesn’t fix this, but it highlights the way patriarchy is actually anti-cypherpunk.

Cypherpunk legend Timothy C. May once described “crypto-anarchy” as “transcending national boundaries and freeing individuals to make the economic arrangements they wish to make consensually.” Likewise, collectives and events like the TransHackFeminist conferences in Spain and Mexico, in 2014 and 2015 respectively, and the subsequent GynePunk collective show a robust discourse among feminists about privacy tech and biohacking.

Unlike most Austrian economics buffs, this sector of the cypherpunk movement is fiercely anti-capitalist. There are also some cypherpunks, such as privacy tech researcher Sarah Jamie Lewis (who contributed a satirical Twitter thread to this anthology), that see significant overlap between the bitcoin ethos and contemporary witchcraft.

As punk activist Nadezhda Tolokonnikova argued: “There were times when women were totally dependent economically on men. Those who were not were branded outcasts and witches, and had to be burned.”

The symbol of a witch, a woman demonized by society for claiming her own power through do-it-yourself rituals, carries an even deeper significance for some women looking to live out these cypherpunk values beyond their screens.

Luckily, events like the Crypto Springs conference, organized by the above-mentioned Demirors and Lightning Labs CEO Elizabeth Stark, show bitcoin community spaces can easily recognize women’s contributions while remaining highly technical. The choice was never between soft skills and rigor, but between acknowledging the diversity that is already present and restricting insights to heterogeneous metrics.

None of this is to say there is a single feminine perspective on the bitcoin economy. To the contrary: the cypherpunk movement incorporates innumerable political viewpoints and values.

What makes Bitcoin distinct from the traditional system is it might become the first network that is less gendered, with greater power bestowed on individuals regardless of social roles.

The bottom line is bitcoin’s fundamental principle is freedom of choice. There is no “right” way to use bitcoin. So we return to the initial question: To hodl or not to hodl?

Well, that depends on how much you own, what you’re buying, and from whom. As for myself, if I have the resources to spend bitcoin on a woman’s handmade silk garment, especially if she is a pre-coiner, I might take those odds. The metaphorical middle finger to historic precedent is just too delicious to ignore.

Perhaps some see bitcoin as a new gold standard. I see it as a silk standard, an asset produced through a collaborative system of labor that can be used in a wide variety of contexts. Much like other ideological movements that came before it, the cypherpunk ideology can evolve through diversification rather than sparking a revolution that yields global “hyperbitcoinization” or goes bust.

We don’t have to get hilariously rich to change the world.

If you want to use bitcoin as a tool to impact social change, regardless of your taste in fashion, perhaps there are other types of transactions that make sense for you.

As for me, the answer is “mostly hodl”— but still look fly while on our way to the moon.
